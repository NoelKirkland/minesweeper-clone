          <p class="game-board__instructions_details-panel__section_section-text">In the beginning, all game tiles are concealed. Hidden among the concealed tiles, and placed at random, are a number of mines (quantity of mines and size of game grid depends on the selected difficulty). An unconcealed, non-mine tile will display a number between 1 through 8, this number represents how many mines are concealed within that tile's immediately adjacent neighboring tiles. For instance, if a revealed tile shows the number 8, that means all 8 of that tile's neighboring tiles are concealing mines. If a revealed tile shows no number at all, that means no mines are concealed within the tile's neighboring tiles.</p>

          <h3 class="game-board__instructions_details-panel__section_section-header">Objective</h3>
          <p class="game-board__instructions_details-panel__section_section-text">To win the game you must reveal all non-mine tiles, leaving concealed only the tiles in which a mine is hidden. If you happen to reveal a mine then the game is lost and you must start over from a new game with mines that have been placed at new, randomly generated coordinates. As your skills improve, use the game timer and try to set a new personal record. Or, play against someone else and see who can win with the fastest time.</p>
